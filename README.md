Design and implement a class that contains instance data for the title, author, publisher and copyright date. Define the Book constructor to accept and initialize this data. Include setter and getter methods for all instance data. Include a toString method that returns a nicely formatted, multi-line description of the book. Create a driver, whose main method instantiates and updates several book objects.
